# ðŸ”§ Fix Email Issue - Step by Step Guide

## ðŸš¨ Current Issue
The OTP email is failing to send because the Gmail credentials are not properly configured.

## âœ… Solution Steps

### Step 1: Access hackathongoo@gmail.com Account
1. Go to [Gmail](https://gmail.com)
2. Sign in with `hackathongoo@gmail.com`
3. If you don't have access, you'll need to:
   - Reset the password, OR
   - Use a different Gmail account that you have access to

### Step 2: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Click on "2-Step Verification"
3. Follow the setup process with your phone number
4. Complete the verification

### Step 3: Generate App Password
1. In Google Account Security, go to "App passwords"
2. Select "Mail" as the app
3. Generate a new 16-character password
4. Copy the password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 4: Update Configuration
Open `email_config.py` and replace `YOUR_APP_PASSWORD_HERE` with your actual App Password:

```python
MAIL_PASSWORD = 'abcd efgh ijkl mnop'  # Your actual 16-character password
```

### Step 5: Test Email
Run the test script:
```bash
python test_email.py
```

## ðŸ”„ Alternative: Use Your Own Gmail Account

If you can't access `hackathongoo@gmail.com`, you can use your own Gmail account:

### Option 1: Update email_config.py
```python
MAIL_USERNAME = 'your-email@gmail.com'
MAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'
```

### Option 2: Update app.py directly
Find this line in `app.py`:
```python
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_USERNAME', 'hackathongoo@gmail.com')
```
Change it to:
```python
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_USERNAME', 'your-email@gmail.com')
```

## ðŸ§ª Quick Test

After updating the credentials, test with:
```bash
python test_email.py
```

Enter `askotal07@gmail.com` as the test email address.

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result

You should see:
```
âœ… Test email sent successfully!
ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS! Check your email (askotal07@gmail.com) for the test message.
```
